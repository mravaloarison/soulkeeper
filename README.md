## Introduction

**SoulKeeper**, is my project for the hackHarvard 2023 hackathon! It is inspired by the vision of ImmortalAI. It allows users to create and interact with unique avatars that serve as guardians of their memories, thoughts, and stories. These avatars engage in meaningful conversations, share opinions, and help users reflect on their past experiences.

## Project Inspiration

I was guided by the **ImmortalAI**'s introduction, One of [Careyaya](https://www.careyaya.org/)'s innovation projects.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: as the web framework to build the server-side logic.
- **Firebase**: for user authentication.
- **GSAP (GreenSock)**: for creating the UI/UX animations.
- **MULTIavatar API**: I integrated the MULTIavatar API to allow users to create avatars.
- **PostgreSQL (Psql)**: as database to store user data and avatar information.
- **NewsAPI**: NewsAPI was used to generate content from current news, enabling avatars to discuss a wide range of topics.
- **OpenAI's GPT-3**: GPT-3 to generate personalized responses for avatars based on their personality traits and user interactions. Which is not integrated At this time
- **Pico CSS**: for coding plain HTML with very basic and very simple style for webUI
- **Simple MATH**: Logics to create precisions of data output

## Features

- **Create Avatars**: Users can create an avatars.

- **Express Yourself**: Users can write about their opinions, share ideas, stories, and memories with their avatars. The avatar will become a reflection of the user thoughts and experiences.

- **Learn and Grow**: The Avatars will learn from the ideas users write about various topics. This learning process helps the avatars understand their users vision and allows for more personalized interactions.

- **News Topics**: Current news topics will be provided so the user can give an idea to the avatar how they think about certain situation. It's meantime a great way to stay informed and discuss the latest events with your avatar.
